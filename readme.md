# COL730: Intro. to Parallel and Distributed Programming

These are my implementations of the problem statements given to us.
I had taken the course in Fall 2022 under Prof. Rijurekha Sen. 
The problem statements can be found on the [course webpage](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rijurekha/col730_2022/mpi_assignment.html).
